# AIEP Scratch 2 Qualifying Program
The AIEP Scratch 2 qualifying program was launched in 2021 with the objective of **introducing competitive programming to grade school students via Scratch 3**, a block-based programming language developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Group.

## Curriculum Design
For AIEP Scratch 2, I designed a 10-session curriculum with the following rationale:
- The first five sessions are dedicated to reinforcing topics that are generally considered challenging by Scratch 1 trainees (as identified in consultation with the 2020 AIEP Scratch 1 mentors). To broaden their programming toolset, two new concepts are also introduced, namely recursion and lists. 
- The latter half is intended to serve as a gateway to competitive programming through a discussion of selected algorithmic paradigms. 
- The last session before the final exam aims to promote an interdisciplinary appreciation for programming by exploring how physics simulations can be done in Scratch.

<sup>1</sup> The author of the materials for Session 1 also added a discussion of the Cartesian plane. <br>
<sup>2</sup> The author of the materials for Session 3 also added a discussion of the decimal and binary number systems.

## Contributed Materials
I was given the opportunity to prepare the materials for the following sessions:

### Session 4
The material is divided into two parts:
- The first part serves to give a more formal treatment of debugging.
- The second part introduces the idea of recursion. The construction of the Koch curve (one of the earliest described fractals) via the Pen Tool extension and recursive My Blocks is taught to motivate the discussion.

### Session 7
The material serves to introduce divide-and-conquer algorithms. It is divided into two parts (for discrete and continuous spaces, respectively):
- The first part gives a conceptual overview of mergesort and delves into the implementation of binary searching. Importing CSV <i>(comma-separated values)</i> files into Scratch lists is also discussed.
- <b>[Optional, depending on the pacing of the trainees]</b> The second part focuses on the bisection method. The construction of graphs of (mathematical) functions via the Pen Tool extension is taught to motivate the discussion.

### Session 8
The material serves to introduce greedy algorithms. Representative problems from programming contests, such as Shopaholic and Dragon of Loowater (as suggested by Halim and Halim in their <i>Competitive Programming</i> series), are also discussed.
