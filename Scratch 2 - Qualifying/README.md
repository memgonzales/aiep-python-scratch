# AIEP Scratch 2 Qualifying Program
The AIEP Scratch 2 qualifying program was launched in 2021 with the goal of introducing competitive programming to grade school students using Scratch 3, a block-based programming language developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Group.

## Curriculum Design
For AIEP Scratch 2, I designed a 10-session curriculum with the following rationale:
- The first five sessions are dedicated to reinforcing topics generally considered challenging by Scratch 1 trainees (as identified in consultation with fellow 2020 AIEP Scratch 1 mentors). To broaden the students' programming toolset, two new concepts &mdash; recursion and lists &mdash; are also introduced. 
- The latter half is intended to serve as a gateway to competitive programming through a discussion of selected algorithmic paradigms. 
- The last session before the final exam aims to promote an interdisciplinary appreciation for programming by exploring how physics simulations can be done in Scratch.

9 | Simulating Physics in Scratch
10 | Final Exam

<sup>1</sup> The author of the materials for Session 1 added a discussion of the Cartesian plane. <br>
<sup>2</sup> The author of the materials for Session 3 added a discussion of the decimal and binary number systems.

## Contributed Materials
I was given the opportunity to prepare the materials for the following sessions:

### Session 4
The material is divided into two parts:
- The first part serves to give a more formal treatment of debugging.
- The second part introduces the idea of recursion. The construction of the Koch curve (one of the earliest described fractals) via the Pen Tool extension and recursive My Blocks is taught to motivate the discussion.

### Session 7
The material introduces divide-and-conquer algorithms. It is divided into two parts, corresponding to discrete and continuous spaces:
- The first part gives a conceptual overview of mergesort and delves into the implementation of binary search. Importing CSV files into Scratch lists is also discussed.
- <b>[Optional, depending on the trainees' pacing]</b> The second part focuses on the bisection method. Graphing mathematical functions via the Pen Tool extension is taught to motivate the discussion.

### Session 8
The material introduces greedy algorithms. Representative problems from programming contests, such as [Shopaholic](https://open.kattis.com/problems/shopaholic) and [Dragon of Loowater](https://open.kattis.com/problems/loowater) (as suggested by Halim and Halim in their <i>Competitive Programming</i> series), are also discussed.

## Notes
- The materials in this repository were last updated in March 2021.
- In July 2022, the Scratch 2 program was renamed AIEP 2.
