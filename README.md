# AMSLI Informatics Enrichment Program
This repository contains the materials that I wrote for the <b>AMSLI Informatics Enrichment Program (AIEP)</b>. Organized by the Asian MathSci League, Inc. (AMSLI) in partnership with the National Olympiad in Informatics Philippines (NOI.PH), this training program has two stages:
- A 10-Saturday **qualifying program** where we train Filipino students and select those who will be invited to join the send-off program
- A 10-Saturday **send-off program** where qualified students are given addition training in preparation for representing the country in global and international informatics, computational thinking, and programming competitions. 

These contests include:

- Dr CT International Competition (Design Thinking with Robotics and Computational Thinking International Competition) <i>organized by the Singapore International Math Contests Centre</i>
- Bebras International Challenge on Informatics and Computational Thinking <i>organized by the Bebras Community</i>
- Global Math and Coding Competition <i>organized by the World Mind Innovation League</i>

## Contributions
I have written materials and helped design the curricula for the following AIEP training programs:
- [**Python 1 (Introductory Python) Send-off Program**](https://github.com/memgonzales/aiep-python-scratch/tree/master/Python%201%20-%20Send-off) *launched in 2020*
- [**Scratch 2 (Scratch for Competitive Programming) Qualifying Program**](https://github.com/memgonzales/aiep-python-scratch/tree/master/Scratch%202%20-%20Qualifying) *launched in 2021*
- **Scratch 2 (Scratch for Competitive Programming) Send-off Program** *launched in 2022*
- **Python 2 (Python for Competitive Programming) Send-off Program** *launched in 2022*

## About AMSLI
Established in 2017, the Asian MathSci League, Inc. (AMSLI) is a nonstock, nonprofit organization of mathematics, science, and informatics mentors that aims to foster global competitiveness among Filipino students and teachers by organizing seminar-workshops and training programs and by sending contingents to international correspondences and competitions. Awardees are recognized by the Department of Science and Technology through its Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI).
