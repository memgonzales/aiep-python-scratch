# AIEP Python 1 Send-off Program
The AIEP Python 1 send-off program was launched in 2021 with the objective of preparing students to represent the country in global and international informatics, computational thinking, and programming competitions. The trainees were selected based on their performance in the AIEP Python 1 (Introductory Python) qualifying program.

## Curriculum Design
For the AIEP Python 1 send-off, I designed the curriculum for the last five sessions with the following rationale:
- Sessions 6 to 8 are intended to formally introduce the trainees to data structures and algorithms.
- Sessions 9 to 10 are opportunities to apply these newly learned concepts and techniques to solving more challenging programming problems &mdash; with the aim of exposing the trainees to actual competition questions and promoting an appreciation for new problem-solving paradigms.

Session | Topic
-- | --
6 | Algorithmic Efficiency<br>Bitwise Operators
7 | Introduction to Data Structures
8 | Introduction to Algorithm Design
9 | Programming Challenges 1
10 | Programming Challenges 2

## Contributed Materials
I was given the opportunity to prepare the materials for the following sessions:

### Session 6
This session serves to introduce the notion of algorithmic efficiency and how it is expressed using the Big O notation. Some efficient algorithms (e.g., binary search and exponentiation by squaring) are presented to motivate the transition from naive solutions. Bitwise operators are also discussed.

### Session 7
This session serves to introduce some common data structures and abstract data types: stacks, queues, trees (including binary search trees), and graphs. Tree and graph traversal algorithms, as well as insertion and searching operations on binary search trees, are also discussed.

### Session 8
This session serves to introduce some useful algorithm design paradigms: divide and conquer, greedy algorithm, and dynamic programming. Representatives examples, such as mergesort, Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, and getting the longest common subsequence, are also discussed.

### Sessions 9 and 10
These sessions serve to expose the trainees to an assortment of programming challenges of varying difficulty. Some of the problems in these handouts are taken from the Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC).
